# Real-Life-Human-Counting-System

Hello there! I have created a software program that is able to detect the moving objects and count the number of objects and classifying the count as going up or down.

For implementation of the same program I have used various Python libraries and Frameworks as numPy, OpenCV, randint, etc.

For processing on image I have used OpenCV functionalities such as VideoWriter(), VdeoWriter_fourcc(), and designed the window size and frame rate for encoding the video input.

Add on to this provision, for smooth ongoing of the program and for better efficiency I have added a method to eliminate shadows using Binarization technique to get more precise output. I have done the same using OpenCV function named createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2().

The software program has applications in security, analysis and surveillance, etc. Proud to create such innovative and real-life application based software. Looking forward to do more in this domain.
Happy learning ðŸ˜Š
